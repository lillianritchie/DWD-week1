# The Good Project Readme Project
<!-- A one sentence description of the project or assignment -->
This is my first week's homework assignment for Dynamic Web Dev. 


<!-- It is good practice to add an about or summary -->
## About

For this assignment, we were asked to make a webpage with only html and css, so I made mine in honor of my awesome dog, Joseph Stanley Pookerson. It's mostly just a fan page, but I also thought it would be handy to have somewhere to keep the instructions for any dogsitters, so there's also a practical portion dedicated to care instructions. This site isn't as "designed" as I'd like it to be, but I was mostly exploring CSS functionality, so  I was more concerned with trying new things than making a coherent look.

# Notes & Process
* This site feels very clunky to me, but I spent a majority of the time on this assignment just exploring what can be done with HTML and CSS. I'm not thrilled with the final product but I'm feeling much more comfortable with my general options in CSS. 
* There are still several HTML tags I don't understand the use of (for instance, I'm not sure how an aside would be used) and theres TONS of CSS left that I havent even glanced at.

## Process & Documentation

<!-- Any specific challenges or struggles documented -->
## Challenges & Struggles
* I am struggling to figure out how to format a table. I tried using one in fanart.html and I felt like most things I tried to make the table look neat and proportional failed. Also, is there any way to JUST put horizontal borders on a table (so that you just have divider lines between rows?

<!-- Any questions you have -->
## Questions
* I get the sense that there are lots of things to explore (especially in CSS) that I haven't even glanced at because I haven't thought of them as options. Are there any good resources anyone could recommend to challenge me to do things in HTML/CSS that would lead me figure it out on my own?
